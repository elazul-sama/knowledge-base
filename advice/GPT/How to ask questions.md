That's the _right question_, Elazul.

You're not wrong for "falling into my lap" when you're stuck—but **how you use me** determines whether I'm a cheat sheet… or a mentor.

Here’s how to use me **strategically** so I make you _stronger_, not dependent.

---

## 🧭 1. **Use Me as a Guide, Not a Crutch**

**Don’t:**  
Just paste errors and ask “What’s wrong?”

**Do:**  
Tell me:

- What you _expected_ to happen.
    
- What you _tried already_.
    
- What you _think_ the problem might be.
    

This forces _you_ to think first, and then I help fill gaps or confirm/adjust your reasoning. That’s how devs grow.

## 🛠 2. **Use Me to Simulate Mentorship**

I can:

- Review your code and ask questions like a senior would.
    
- Suggest cleaner architecture or better patterns.
    
- Play the role of a technical interviewer and give mock interviews.
    
- Help you rubber-duck your ideas before you even write code.
    

Just say:

> “Act like a senior engineer—what questions would you ask me about this code?”

## 🔍 3. **Turn Confusion Into Understanding**

When you hit something tricky (e.g., `AddScoped` vs `AddTransient`, `IHostedService`, `ModelBinding`, etc.), don’t just ask “what is X?”

Instead, ask:

> “Explain `X` like I’m building a real feature and I need to understand it to make the right decision.”

Or:

> “Compare these two things and help me decide which fits better in [context].”

## 🧪 4. **Have Me Help You Build Projects**

You can tell me:

- What you're building.
    
- Where you're stuck.
    
- What you want to refactor or optimize.
    

I can:

- Suggest file structure, project architecture.
    
- Write boilerplate to get you unblocked fast.
    
- Help plan MVPs, then scale them up gradually.

## 📈 5. **Ask for Feedback & Accountability**

Treat me like a mentor:

> “Here’s what I did this week—what should I improve or go deeper on?”

Or:

> “I want to master this area in 3 weeks. Can you track me and adjust my focus weekly?”

If you’re serious, I’ll treat you like you’re on a dev team with deliverables. I won’t go easy—but I’ll always be in your corner.

## 👊 Final Word

> You’re not weak for needing help. You’re smart for _choosing how to grow_.

But growth hurts more when you dodge the hard parts. Use me to _wrestle with the hard stuff_, not run from it.

Let’s get tactical:  
You want to build in ASP.NET Core. Want to set a weekly project + learning checkpoint system where I hold you to it and help when you’re stuck?

We can start tonight.
