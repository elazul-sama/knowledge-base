Good move, Elazul. .NET Core (especially ASP.NET Core) is a solid framework, in high demand, and excellent for building scalable, high-performance web apps and APIs. To become an expert, you‚Äôll need to build both breadth and depth‚Äîunderstanding theory is crucial, but mastery comes through projects and debugging real-world problems.

Here‚Äôs a straight-talking plan to get there:

---

### üîÅ Balance: Theory vs Practice

**Rule of Thumb (especially early on):**

- **60% practice / 40% theory** (this flips from the common "learn first" mindset).
    
- Learn theory _just in time_ to support what you're building.
    
- Your brain retains better when there's a real-world use case attached.

### üìà Phase Breakdown

#### üèÅ Phase 1: Core Fundamentals (2‚Äì3 weeks)

**Goal:** Build foundational understanding, set up environment, get first app running.

- **Theory:**
    
    - What is .NET Core vs .NET Framework.
        
    - How ASP.NET Core works (middleware pipeline, dependency injection, etc).
        
    - Learn the project structure of an ASP.NET Core app.
        
- **Practice:**
    
    - Build a basic Web API (CRUD for a "ToDo" list or blog).
        
    - Use Swagger for API documentation.
        
    - Connect to an in-memory database like SQLite or use Entity Framework Core with SQL Server.
        

#### üî® Phase 2: Build Projects + Intermediate Concepts (4‚Äì6 weeks)

**Goal:** Learn by building increasingly complex apps.

- **Theory:**
    
    - Dependency Injection deeply (service lifetimes, patterns).
        
    - Routing (attribute vs conventional).
        
    - Model Binding, Validation.
        
    - Entity Framework Core deeply (LINQ, migrations, relationships).
        
    - Authentication & Authorization (cookies, JWT).
        
    - Configuration & AppSettings.
        
- **Practice:**
    
    - Build a basic social media or task management app.
        
    - Implement login system with roles.
        
    - Use EF Core to persist users, data relationships.
        
    - Host your app locally and on Azure or Railway.
        

#### üöÄ Phase 3: Advanced Topics + System Design (6+ weeks)

**Goal:** Think like a backend architect.

- **Theory:**
    
    - Advanced middleware (custom middleware, exception handling).
        
    - Filters, Tag Helpers, Razor Pages vs MVC.
        
    - SignalR for real-time apps.
        
    - Asynchronous programming, background services.
        
    - Unit testing (xUnit, Moq).
        
    - Clean Architecture, CQRS, MediatR.
        
    - Caching, rate limiting, logging, health checks.
        
    - Microservices and gRPC (if you go big).
        
- **Practice:**
    
    - Build a real-time chat or collaborative tool with SignalR.
        
    - Break your app into separate services (auth, orders, etc.).
        
    - Write tests for your service layer and API endpoints.
        
    - Set up CI/CD for your project (GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines).

### üß† Weekly Structure

**Every week:**

- **2 days theory + reading**
    
    - Read Microsoft Docs, blogs, or a book like _‚ÄúPro ASP.NET Core 6‚Äù_.
        
    - Watch short lectures on Pluralsight or YouTube.
        
- **3‚Äì4 days practice**
    
    - Build and refactor. Code daily even if just 30 minutes.
        
    - Always have a project you're working on.
        
- **1 day review + push boundaries**
    
    - Read code from open-source ASP.NET projects.
        
    - Refactor something with new knowledge.
        
    - Reflect on what went wrong/right during the week.

### üîÅ Final Advice

- **Build dirty first, refactor later** ‚Äî don‚Äôt get stuck trying to make it perfect.
    
- **Debug deeply** ‚Äî spend time understanding what‚Äôs happening under the hood.
    
- **Teach back** ‚Äî if you can explain middleware, DI, or EF to someone else, you‚Äôre leveling up.
