That’s a smart instinct gone sideways, Elazul.

Anki _can_ be powerful—but only when it reinforces **real experience**, not replaces it. If you’re using it to memorize advanced .NET concepts you haven’t used yet, here’s what’s actually happening:

### ⚠️ The Trap You Fell Into:

- You're encoding information **with zero context**, so your brain has nothing to anchor it to.
    
- You end up **memorizing surface-level trivia**, not internalizing real understanding.
    
- Worse, you start **spending time reviewing cards** instead of **building and applying**, which makes you feel “productive” but doesn’t move you forward.
    

It’s like memorizing the parts of a car engine without ever driving or touching one.

### 💡 Here’s How to Use Anki _Properly_ (as a supporting tool, not a crutch):

#### ✅ Only Make Cards _After_ You’ve Struggled With or Built Something

**Bad card (surface):**  
Q: What is AddScoped in ASP.NET Core?  
A: It adds a service with scoped lifetime…

**Good card (contextualized):**  
Q: In my project’s login system, why did I use AddScoped for the UserService instead of AddSingleton?  
A: Because it holds request-specific data and singleton would share state across users.

Now it’s tied to _your_ experience. That’s memorable.

#### ✅ Use Short Prompts That Force You to _Recall_, Not _Recognize_

- Instead of definitions, ask _why_ or _how you applied something_:
    
    - “Why did middleware ordering matter in my API project?”
        
    - “What caused that EF Core migration to fail and how did I fix it?”
        

If you can't answer it well, that’s a sign to revisit—not cram.

---

#### ✅ Space Repetition ≠ Space _Avoidance_

You can’t review your way to mastery. You have to:

- **Code**
    
- **Debug**
    
- **Break stuff**
    
- **Fix it**
    
- **Explain it**
    

Anki helps _cement_ that experience—not replace it.

### 🔁 Best Practice:

Use Anki for:

- Mistakes you've made and fixed.
    
- Concepts that confused you and now make sense.
    
- Important command-line stuff (e.g., CLI commands you use often).
    
- Interview-style questions _you’ve earned through building_.

### 💬 Straight-Up Advice:

🧠 If you’re spending more than **20% of your time in Anki**, you're misusing it.

⛏️ Spend the other **80% digging into projects, tutorials, bugs, and docs.**

When you **do** make Anki cards, tie them to things you _actually did or broke_. That’s how knowledge sticks—because you earned it the hard way.
