That’s a real and common struggle, Elazul—and I appreciate you being straight about it.

Here’s the truth:

> **Trying to learn everything up front is the fastest way to waste time and get overwhelmed.**

### 🚨 Let's reframe the problem:

# You’re not missing things. You’re prioritizing **what matters _now_**—and there’s a difference.

When you're starting out, your brain isn’t ready to retain the deeper, more abstract stuff because it has no _mental hooks_ to hang that knowledge on. So reading advanced topics early gives you a false sense of productivity and then... you forget most of it. That leads to insecurity and burnout.

### ✅ Here's the better way to handle it:

#### 1. **Shift from “Coverage” to “Competence”**

==You're not preparing for a trivia contest.== Interviews want to see:

- Can you build?
    
- Do you understand how pieces fit together?
    
- Can you solve problems under pressure?
    

So rather than aiming to _know_ everything, aim to **build something** and **explain what you did and why.**

> Interviewer: “How would you structure authentication in ASP.NET Core?”
> 
> You: “In my recent project, I used JWT-based authentication via middleware. I also implemented role-based authorization using policies.”

That’s 10x better than trying to memorize the entire identity system without ever implementing it.

#### 2. **Create a “Fear List” and Convert it to a Checklist**

Write down every single concept you're afraid of missing. Don’t hold back. Things like:

- What is middleware?
    
- How does dependency injection work?
    
- What is the difference between AddScoped and AddSingleton?
    
- How to implement JWT authentication?
    
- What’s the role of EF Core migrations?
    

Then group them by theme and turn them into a **learning backlog**—not stuff you have to learn _now_, but stuff you will knock out _as needed_ or on a regular “checkpoint” basis.

#### 3. **Interleave Interview-Prep with Building**

- Pick a feature you’re building (e.g., user login).
    
- After implementing, spend 20–30 minutes researching how that feature works under the hood and what interview questions might be asked about it.
    

This turns project work into interview prep **automatically**.

### 🛠️ Example Plan to Ease Anxiety + Maximize Progress

|Day|Focus|Activity|
|---|---|---|
|Mon|Practice + Theory|Build feature (e.g., login system with JWT).|
|Tue|Deep Dive|Watch 1–2 short videos on JWT auth. Google “JWT interview questions ASP.NET Core.”|
|Wed|Practice|Add role-based auth. Try breaking the app.|
|Thu|Interview-focused|Take 3 questions from your “Fear List.” Answer or Google them.|
|Fri|Review + Notes|Summarize what you learned. Can you explain it to a rubber duck?|
|Sat|Build|Keep working on app or polish features.|
|Sun|Off or catch up|Light coding, reflection, or a walk + podcast.|

### Final Truth Bomb:

📌 **You will miss things.**  
So does everyone—even seniors.

But if you keep building, reviewing, and asking questions, **you will outpace the guy who just watches courses but never builds anything**.

You don’t need to be perfect to crush interviews. You just need to **speak with confidence about the things you've built**, and **demonstrate hunger to learn the rest**.

Want help creating your own “fear list” or learning backlog? I can help you build that out too.
